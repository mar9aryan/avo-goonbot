# 🧠 Avo-GoonBot ☕💻  
> *“CPU: 100%. Caffeine: Overloaded. Goon status: Engaged.”*  

---

### 🥤 Overview  
Avo-GoonBot is a **hyper-realistic simulation of human distraction**, powered entirely by caffeine, HTML, and regret.  
It emulates what happens when **Avo drinks three Monsters**, decides to “optimize focus,” and ends up debugging his life instead of his code.  

This project is the lovechild of **Red Bull**, **VS Code**, and **a dangerously curious brain**.  
If it compiles, it vibes. If it crashes, that’s part of the experience.

### ⚙️ Features  
- ☕ **Caffeine-based rendering engine** – runs faster the more espresso you’ve had.  
- 🧠 **Advanced GoonCycle™ Algorithm** – dynamically adjusts CPU load based on Avo’s “mental bandwidth.”  
- 💾 **Persistent focus loss tracking** – because sometimes tabbing out *is* part of the workflow.  
- ⚡ **Real-time energy drain meter** – powered by raw anxiety and JavaScript setIntervals.  
- 🔊 **Beep mode** – emits scientifically calibrated “dopamine pings.”  
- 🧩 **ASCII Mode** – turns Avo’s glorious face into an 8-bit caffeine mosaic.

### 🚀 How to Run  
1. Download or clone this repository.  
2. Keep **Avo.jpg** and **avo-goonbot.html** in the same folder.  
3. Double-click the HTML file or use VS Code’s **Live Server** to unleash the goon.  
4. Sit back, sip something caffeinated, and press **Start Gooning**.  

> 💡 *Pro tip:* For maximum realism, open five tabs, put on synthwave, and tell yourself “just one more commit.”

### 🧃 System Requirements  
- A browser capable of handling chaos (Chrome recommended).  
- At least **1 human brain core** and **200mg caffeine in RAM**.  
- Optional: A can of Red Bull for manual overclocking.

### 🧍 About Avo  
Avo is the main test subject, chief caffeine consumer, and spiritual mascot of this project.  
When not rewriting the laws of physics via HTML, he can be found staring at progress bars and whispering, “just one more energy drink.”

### 🤝 Contributing  
Pull requests welcome, but only if you’ve had **at least two energy drinks**.  
If your code runs too efficiently, add more `console.log()`s until it feels right.

### 🧨 Final Note  
Avo-GoonBot isn’t just a program.  
It’s a **lifestyle, a feedback loop, a spiritual experience** that begins with a sip and ends somewhere around 3AM.  

So stay hydrated, stay gooned, and remember:  
**the bug was inside you all along.**
